# school_1411
My first package (fuck first)
That is really easy code (experimental). If you want to make something similar, use https://medium.com/@joel.barmettler/how-to-upload-your-python-package-to-pypi-65edc5fe9c56 I am a student of Russian school 1411 (grade 10) and I wanna ask my teacher VI to give me 5 for this small project!
# Usage examples:
Firstly, import my package with cmd: pip install school_1411
My project has only 2 functions: fib_1 and top_secret.
fib_1 is used these way: input the number and the program will give you the first N Fibonacci numbers!
