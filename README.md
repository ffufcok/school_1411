# school_1411
That is really easy code (experimental). If you want to make something similar, use https://medium.com/@joel.barmettler/how-to-upload-your-python-package-to-pypi-65edc5fe9c56 I am a student of Russian school 1411 (grade 11)
 ## Installing
    pip install school_1411
 ## Importing
  You can import my function with the following command: 
 ```
 import school_1411
 ```
 ## Usage
  To find first N Fibonacci numbers call the function `fib_1()` and input your number:
  ```
  school_1411.fib_1()
  ```
  To find the roots of a quadratic or linear equation, use the function:
  ```
  solve(*coefficients)
  ```
  If you call function with 3 arguments, they will be arguments of quadratic equation ax2+bx+c=0. 
  If you call function with 2 arguments, they will be arguments of linear equation bx + c = 0. 
  If you call function with 1 argument, it will be argument of equation c = 0. 
  This function returns a list of results.
   ### That is all by now! See you soon!
